In these Jupyter Notebooks, you will explore the Image Retrieval functionality of Azure Computer Vision 4.0, which is powered by the Florence Foundation model. You will:

* Use the Image Retrieval APIs in Python to search a collection of images to find those that are most similar to a given query image or text prompt.
* Use the Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL to store and query vector data.

Before starting to build your image vector similarity system, follow these steps:

* Sign up for either an [Azure free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=AI-MVP-5004971) or an [Azure for Students account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/students/?WT.mc_id=AI-MVP-5004971). If you already have an active subscription, you can use it.
* Create a Cognitive Services resource in the Azure portal.
    > The Image Retrieval APIs are available in the following regions: East US, France Central, Korea Central, North Europe, Southeast Asia, West Europe, West US.
* Create an Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL cluster.
* Install Python 3.x, Visual Studio Code, Jupyter Notebook and Jupyter Extension for Visual Studio Code.
